                <strong>Q. How is talking at Sanjivini different from talking to a friend / relative?</strong><br />
                A. Most often people were close to (a parent, a child, a husband or wife, a friend, a sibling) even the slightest strain in a relationship could affect us deeply. A difference or misunderstanding, an inability to communicate, feeling guilty or let down could lead us to loneliness, confusion and unhappiness.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>We really want to do something about it... but just don't know how to. Most often we can cope, but at times we do need help or maybe just someone who can listen.</strong><br />
                At Sanjivini we can meet someone who understands us, is concerned and can help.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>Q. Why do I need to talk to a counsellor and not keep trying to resolve things on my own?</strong><br />
                A. All of us go through times when we are worried, depressed or confused. Just like joy, sorrows and problem are a natural part of life and have to be faced and dealt with. Mostly we manage of cope, but there are moments when we are faced with a situation or a problem we can't handle, can't control or just don't know how to deal with.
                We all need a shoulder to cry and unload on. counselling can help relieve emotional pain & suffering. It does help acquire new insights using which we can successfully deal with the problems at hand.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>Q. How long do I need to go for counselling?</strong><br />
                A. The ultimate goal of counselling is self-empowerment. Once we have learned effective coping and problem solving skills, we should be able to deal with most situations ourselves or by talking it over with a confidante. Sometimes people do feel the need to come back to counselling when they enter a completely different phase of their life and they need to learn new skills to cope with, or adjust to an unfamiliar set of circumstances.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>Q. What is counselling? How is it different from advice giving?</strong><br />
                A. Counselling is help for personal or psychological problems, given by a person trained to do so. There are many types of counselling but whatever the approach, the goal is to get a deeper understanding of the problem, however complex it may be, and empower the person seeking help to take care of it.
                <br /><br />

                <strong>Q. What do I do if counselling is not helping me?</strong><br />
                A. The first thing one should do is tell the counsellor. Explain what is not working and why. Discuss with the counsellor how one feels as well as the expectations from the counselling process. However it is important to reflect on what the counsellor says. The reason we need counselling from time to time is that one can see their self-defeating thoughts or behavior and it sometimes take an impartial observer to point out to us what is obvious to others.
